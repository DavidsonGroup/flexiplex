# What does flexiplex do?

Flexiplex is a light weight, flexible, error tolerant search and demultiplexing tool. Given a set of reads as either .fastq or .fasta it will demultiplex and/or identify target sequences, reporting matching reads and read-barcode assignment. It has been designed to demultiplex single cell long read RNA-Seq data, but can be used on any read data like an error tolerance "grep". Flexiplex is built with [edlib](https://github.com/Martinsos/edlib). 

Flexiplex first uses edlib to search for a left and right flanking sequence (primer and polyT) within each read (with barcode and UMI sequence left as a wildcard). For the best match with an edit distance of "f" or less it will trim to the barcode + UMI sequence +/- 5 bp either side, and search for the barcode against a known list. The best matching barcode with an edit distance of "e" or less will be reported. Occassionally reads are chimeric, meaning two or more molecules get sequence togther in the same read. To identify these cases, and chop reads, flexiplex will repeat the search again with the previously found primer to polyT sequence masked out. This is repeated until no new barcodes are found in the read.

If the set of possible barcodes is unknown, flexiplex can be run in discovery mode (by leaving -k option off). In this mode, flexiplex will search for the primer and polyT sequence like usual, and take "b"bp after the primer sequence as a barcode. The frequency that barcodes are found in the data are reported for follow up analysis. For example, if 1000 cells were expected, the top 1000 most frequent barcodes can be used as the known list for a subsequent run of flexiplex.

The primer, polyT, list of barcodes and UMI length and maximum edit distances can all be set through user options (see [Usage](#usage)).

# Installing flexiplex
Download from the [git repository](https://github.com/DavidsonGroup/flexiplex/releases). e.g.
```
wget https://github.com/DavidsonGroup/flexiplex/releases/download/Version-0.97/flexiplex-Version-0.97.tar.gz
```

Untar and unzip:
```
tar -xvf flexiplex-Version-0.97.tar.gz
```

Change into the source directory and compile:
```
cd flexiplex-Version-0.97 ; make
```

You should now have a binary file called flexiplex which you can execute. Alternatively, there are precompiled binaries in the /bin subdirectory for linux and mac, which can be used if compilation fails.

To see usage information, run 
```
./flexiplex -h
```


# Usage

```
FLEXIPLEX 0.97

usage: flexiplex [options] [reads_input]
  reads_input: a .fastq or .fasta file. Will read from stdin if empty.

# Examples of use

## Assigning single cell long reads to 10x 3' cellular barcodes (when barcodes are known)
  
The default settings work for 10x 3' v3 chemistry. To demultiplex run:
```
flexiplex -k barcode_list.txt reads.fastq > new_reads.fastq
```

Or for older chemistry with 10bp UMIs use:
```
flexiplex -u 10 -k barcode_list.txt reads.fastq > new_reads.fastq
```

If dealing with large gzipped files you can pipe reads into flexiplex to avoid unzipping. e.g.
```
gunzip -c read.fastq.gz | flexiplex -k barcode_list.txt | gzip > new_reads.fastq.gz
```
  
## Assigning single cell long reads to 10x 3' cellular barcodes (when barcodes are unknown)

Flexiplex can be run in two passes: 1) to find the barcode sequences and 2) assign them to reads.
To find barcodes, set the flanking edit distance to 0 (a perfect match) as these are less likely to have errors in the barcodes.
```
flexiplex -f 0 reads.fastq
```

The table written to standard output can help to select the number of cells. For example, it can be captured and plotted in R or similar to make a knee plot.

Once the approximate number of cells is know, subset the list of barcodes by this number:

```
head -n <number of cells> flexiplex_barcodes_counts.txt > my_barcode_list.txt
```

> **Optional**: You may also want to filter this list by [the possible 10x barcodes](https://kb.10xgenomics.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004506263-What-is-a-barcode-whitelist-). Flexiplex comes bundled with a standalone script to do this:
> 
> ```
> python scripts/filter_barcodes.py --whitelist 3M-february-2018.txt --no-inflection --outfile my_filtered_barcode_list.txt my_barcode_list.txt
> ```
> 
> This script also allows for the discovery and visualisation of points of inflection as another filtering step. A brief 'autopilot' mode is provided which will determine an inflection point and filter out any cells with a lower count:
> 
> ```
> python scripts/filter_barcodes.py --whitelist 3M-february-2018.txt --outfile my_filtered_barcode_list.txt my_barcode_list.txt
> ```
> 
> **[The usage guide](https://github.com/DavidsonGroup/flexiplex/tree/main/scripts/usage.md) explains how to further use `filter-barcodes.py` to visualise and fine-tune the inflection point result.**

Then use this list to assign barcodes to reads:
```
flexiplex -k my_filtered_barcode_list.txt reads.fastq > new_reads.fastq
```

## Demultiplexing other read data by barcode

To demultiplex with other flanking and barcodes sequences, set these e.g.:
```
flexiplex -l <left flank> -k "<barcode1>,<barcode2>,<barcode3>,..." -r <right flank> -u 0 reads.fastq > new_reads.fastq
```

This assumes no UMI sequence is present. -e and -f which are the maximum barcode and flanking sequence edit distances may also need to be adjusted. As a guide we use -e 2 for 16bp barcodes and -f 12 for 32bp (left+right) flanking sequence.

If barcodes are expected at the start and end of reads, force flexiplex not to chop reads when mutiple barcodes are seen (-i false). Reads can be separated into different files by barcodes (-s true).
```
flexiplex -i false -s true -l <left flank> -k "<barcode1>,<barcode2>,<barcode3>,..." -r <right flank> -u 0
```

flexiplex expects a left flanking sequence, so if barcodes are a fixed number of bases at the very start of a read you can add sequence to the beginnning to anchor the search. e.g. using "START" to anchor:

```
cat file.fastq | sed "/[@,+]/! s/^/START/g" | flexiplex -l "START" -r "" -u 0 -f 0 -k my_barcode_list.txt
```

## Assigning genotype to cells - long reads

This is similar to [Demultiplexing other read data by barcode](#demultiplexing-other-read-data-by-barcode), but different alleles can be used in place of barcodes. e.g. to search for the KRAS variant c.34G>A run:

```
flexiplex -i false -l "GTATCGTCAAGGCACTCTTGCCTACGC" -k "CACTAGC,CACCAGC" -r "TCCAACTACCACAAGTTTATATTCAGT" -e 0 -f 15 -u 0 reads.fasta > kras_var_reads.fasta
```

Where -k here lists the mutant and wild type variants (reverse complimented), with a few bp either side, and -l and -r are the adjacent sequence left and right of these respectively.

Multiple searches can be chained together. e.g. assign cellular barcodes then search for a specific mutation:
```
flexiplex -k barcode_list.txt reads.fasta | flexiplex -n barcode_mutation_mapping -i false -l "GTATCGTCAAGGCACTCTTGCCTACGC" -k "CACTAGC,CACCAGC" -r "TCCAACTACCACAAGTTTATATTCAGT" -e 0 -f 15 -u 0 reads.fasta > kras_var_reads_with_barcodes.fasta
```

## Assigning genotype to cells - short reads

Flexiplex can be also be used on 10x short read data to search for cells with a specific target sequence such as a mutation or fusion of interest from the raw read data. This is essentially a combination of [Simple searching](##Simple-search) and [Demultiplexing other read data by barcode](#Demultiplexing-other-read-data-by-barcode). Here you "paste" the two read ends together and run in a similar way as you would for long reads. e.g. To search for an NPM1 variant common in AML cancers, c.863_864insTCTG, on 10x 3' data: 

``` 
paste Sample_R1.fastq Sample_R2.fastq | sed "/[@,+]/! s/^/CTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT/g" | flexiplex -l <left seq> -k "TCTG" -r <right seq> -u 0 -i false | flexiplex
```
This prefixes the read (before the barcodes) with the 10x primer (CTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT), searches for the variant, then searches for the barcode immediately after the primer and returns a list of barcodes with the variant in flexiplex_barcodes_counts.txt. The read IDs can be found in flexiplex_reads_barcodes.txt

In this example we assume no sequencing errors in the barcodes as the data is Illumina, however a barcode list could also be provided (to the final command) to error correct. The order of demuliplexing and searching can also be switched. e.g.:

``` 
paste Sample_R1.fastq Sample_R2.fastq | sed "/[@,+]/! s/^/CTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT/g" | flexiplex -k barcodes_list.txt | flexiplex -l <left seq> -k "TCTG" -r <right seq> -u 0 -i false
```

## Simple search

To perform a simple error tolerant grep-like search of a single sequence, define the sequence with -l and the
required edit distance with -f, then set -k "?" -r "" -e 0 -b 0 -u 0 to switch off searching for a barcode, umi or right flank. -i false ensures that the full read is returned and not trimmed (note that it may be reverse complimented still). e.g.
```
flexiplex -l "CACTCTTGCCTACGCCACTAGC" -f 3 -k "?" -r "" -e 0 -b 0 -u 0 -i false reads.fasta
```


alternatively the search sequence can be split between the -l and -k (or -k and -r) options. e.g.:
```
flexiplex -i false -l "CACTCTTGCCTACGC" -k "CACTAGC" -f 3 -e 0 reads.fasta
```

Matching reads will be printed to standard out. Edit distances (-e and -f ) can be adjusted as required.

## Extracting UMIs from PCR-cDNA ONT data

Recent library prepration kits for ONT PCR amplified cDNA attach unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to the 5' end of transcripts. These can be used for deduplication in downstream data analysis. The UMI sequence for each read can be extracted using flexiplex:
```
flexiplex -l TTGGTGCTGATATT -k "GCTTT" -r TTTGGGG -u 22 -f 3 -e 1 reads.fastq
```
The UMIs will be added to the read ID in the output .fastq file and flexiplex_reads_barcodes.txt will contain a list of identified UMIs. Note that the barcode sequence here, GCTTT comes from the left flanking sequence is needed as a placeholder. The example above comes from data we have tested on and may need to be adjusted for different library preparation kits.


# Output

## New reads file

Read with a matching barcode will be reported to standard output (or to individual files if the -s true option is provided).

If read chopping and ID replacement is used (-i true, default):
  - Read IDs will be replaced with the following format (similar to FLAMES): <barcode>_<UMI>#<original ID>_<+/-><N>of<M> where <+/-> indicates whether the barcode was found on the forward or reverse strand of the original read, M is the number of barcodes found in direction indicated by +/- and N is the 1st, 2nd etc. of those barcode.
  - Reads will be reverse complimented if the barcode was found in the reverse direction. For 10x 3' data this puts all reads in the reverse direction of the mRNA (3'->5')
  - If multiple barcodes are found in the same direction the read is split at the position of the second or subsequent primer, and multiple reads reported.
  - The primer+barcode+umi+polyT sequence is removed from the read.
If barcodes are found in both the forward and reverse directions on a read, the same read would be reported multiple time (once forward and once reverse). To overcome this duplication, data can be mapped as stranded

![Reads chopping](/flexiplex/docs/assets/flexplex2.png)
Schematic of default behaviour if multiple barcodes are identified in a read

  
 If read chopping and ID replacement is not used (-i false):
  - Any read with matching flank and barcode sequence will be reported with read ID appended with _<+/-> as above.
  - Read is reported only once even if multiple flank/barcode sequences found
  - If a flank/barcode is only found in the reverse direction, the read will be reverse complimented.

  
## Table of barcodes found for each read

This will be a file called flexiplex_reads_barcodes.txt or <prefix>_reads_barcodes.txt if the -n option was provided.
It is a tab delimited text file with a row for each barcode identified. e.g.
```
Read	CellBarcode	FlankEditDist	BarcodeEditDist	UMI
SRR12282458.3	CTCAGAAGTTTGCATG	5	0	TTCTTAGCGA
SRR12282458.4	CGACTTCAGCTGTCTA	1	0	ACCGCATCCG
SRR12282458.6	GTAGGCCCAAGGCTCC	0	0	ATTATATCCT
SRR12282458.8	TCTCATATCACTCCTG	2	1	GAGCCCTGGG
SRR12282458.9	GTAGTCATCGTTTATC	1	0	TGCTGTATAG
SRR12282458.10	TGACTTTGTATAATGG	1	0	CCCTAATATT
...
```

## Table of barcode frequency

This will be a file called flexiplex_barcodes_counts.txt or <prefix>_reads_barcodes.txt if the -n option was provided. It will only be created if flexiplex is run in barcode discovery mode (no barcode list provided with -k).
 
It lists the number of reads that each barcode was found in, ordered by the more frequent. e.g. for a small dataset
```
GATCGATTCATCGCTC	15
AACCATGCACCTTGTC	12
ACGTCAAGTTTAAGCC	11
GTAACTGCATTGGGCC	11
AAGGCAGCATGGGAAC	10
ATGCGATTCACCTTAT	10
GATGCTAGTACAGCAG	10
GCAGCCATCATGCATG	10
GTTCATTCAATGTTGC	10
...
```
If the approximate number of cells is estimated, the top of this list can be used to generate a list of known barcodes e.g.
```
head -n <number of cell> flexiplex_barcodes_counts.txt > known_barcodes.txt
```
Then flexiplex run with -k known_barcodes.txt to more accurately assign the barcodes to reads (note that the second column in known_barcodes.txt gets ignored).
  
## Table of the number of barcode at each barcode frequency

This is printed to standard output when no barcodes are provided (ie. flexiplex is in barcode discovery mode and -k not provided).
e.g. for a small dataset:
```
Reads	Barcodes
15	1
14	0
13	0
12	1
11	2
10	5
9	6
8	13
7	22
6	17
5	29
4	62
3	86
2	124
1	1867
```
The first line can be interpreted as there was 1 barcode which was found in 15 reads etc. This data is provided to help work out how many cells were sequenced (e.g. by creating a knee plot).

# Tips to speed up flexiplex

Flexiplex can be slow if checking against a large number of barcodes (>1000) in noisy reads. Below are a few ideas you can try to speed up barcode demultiplexing:
  1. Run flexiplex in barcode [discovery mode](#assigning-single-cell-long-reads-to-10x-3-cellular-barcodes-when-barcodes-are-unknown), then intersect the found barcodes with the known list to reduce the search space.
  2. Flexiplex now supports multi-threaded, but can still be I/O limited. You may be able to achieve faster parallel excecution by splitting the .fasta or .fastq into several smaller files and running flexiplex on each in parallel. The split linux command can help split files up. Passing flexiplex a read filename, rather than the reads through stdin, may also be faster on some platforms.
  3. Reduce the tolerated edit distance of the flanking and barcode sequence (-f and -e flags)
