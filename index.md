# What does flexiplex do

Flexiplex is a light weight, flexible, error tolerant search and demultiplex tool. Given a set of reads as either .fastq or .fasta it will demultiplex and/or identify target sequences, reporting matching reads and a table of read-sequence assignments. It has been designed to demultuplex single cell long read RNA-Seq data, but can be used on any read data like an error tolerance "grep".
